# DCGAN Example

We first build the gotorch project. For how to build and test, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/wangkuiyi/gotorch/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Then, we run the following command in the root directory to install gotorch project.

```bash
go install ./...
```

The `dcgan` binary will be installed at `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

Then, we execute the compiled binary in current directory to train the model:

```bash
$GOPATH/bin/dcgan
[0/30][0] D_Loss: 1.511980 G_Loss: 1.214779
[0/30][1] D_Loss: 0.991748 G_Loss: 1.575888
[0/30][2] D_Loss: 0.774483 G_Loss: 2.076495
[0/30][3] D_Loss: 0.647692 G_Loss: 2.421216
[0/30][4] D_Loss: 0.577828 G_Loss: 2.674094
[0/30][5] D_Loss: 0.558098 G_Loss: 2.808377
[0/30][6] D_Loss: 0.561936 G_Loss: 2.944061
[0/30][7] D_Loss: 0.513400 G_Loss: 3.169870
[0/30][8] D_Loss: 0.470114 G_Loss: 3.544255
[0/30][9] D_Loss: 0.457290 G_Loss: 3.877758
```

The training program periodically generates image samples and saves to pickle files.
We use the `pickle_to_png.py` to transform the saved pickle files into png format.

```bash
python pickle_to_png.py
```

Here are some generated images after 15 epoches training:
